# Introduction
In the previous module, you configured a Go environment to create and run programs written in Go. You also learned the basics of Go programs' coding structure and learned how to compile and run an application.

In this module, you'll take a step forward by learning the basic data types available in Go and organizing the code you write in a `.go` file by using functions. Additionally, you'll learn how to manage and write programs in different files under the same package. And finally, you'll learn how to create and use packages in Go.

## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will: 
* Learn how to declare variables and constants
* Learn about the basic data types available in Go
* Learn how to write functions
* Learn how to create and use packages

## Prerequisites
* A Go environment ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and VS Code with the Go extension installed. Alternatively, you could use the Go Playground.
* Able to create and modify `.go` files
* Able to run Go applications using the terminal prompt
