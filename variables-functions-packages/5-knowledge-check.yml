  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How do you declare and initialize a variable?"
    choices:
    - content: "var firstName string"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement declares a variable."
    - content: "firstName := \"John\""
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This statement declares and initialized a variable."
    - content: "string firstName = \"John\""
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement will result in a syntax error. Additionally, you don't need to specify a type as Go will infer the type is string."
    - content: "firstName = \"John\""
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is close, but will result in an error where firstName is undefined. The declaration syntax (:=) is missing here."
  - content: "What happens when you've declared variables but don't use them?"
    choices:
    - content: "You simply get a warning."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You will not get a warning, but will receive something else instead."
    - content: "Nothing, there's no problem if you have unused objects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is, in fact, a problem when a declared variable is not used."
    - content: "You get a warning, but the next time it won't compile."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You will get something other than a warning."
    - content: "You get an error; the program doesn't compile."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Go requires that variables are used in programs or will throw an error that the variable was declared but not used."
  - content: "How do data conversion types work in Go?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have to do conversion explicitly; implicit conversion doesn't work in Go."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With Go, you need to be very explicit when converting a value from one type to another."
    - content: "You can do implicit casting from `int` to `int32`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If you try to do this the program will result in an 'invalid operation' error."
    - content: "You can only do it through external libraries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Conversions don't need to be done in external libraries. You can use a built-in function or package instead."
    - content: "You can't convert from `int` to `string`, or vice-versa."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can use either the strconv or fmt package to convert from an int to string"
  - content: "Why would you use pointers in Go?"
    choices:
    - content: "Go doesn't have support for pointers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Go does in fact have support for pointers. A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable."
    - content: "To free-up memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When you send a pointer to a function, you're not passing the value but an address memory. That means the variable and it's value still exists is taking up memory."
    - content: "To change variable values from the function caller."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Pointers make it possible to change to change a variable's value in a function because it passes a copy of the value."
  - content: "How do you differentiate between a package and a standalone application?"
    choices:
    - content: "A standalone application uses the package main, and a package (library) use a different name."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The main package indicates that your program will produce a standalone executable."
    - content: "You either have to run `go create library` and `go create program`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. `go create library` and `go create program` are invalid commands."
    - content: "It doesn't matter; it depends on how you use the code once you've finish programming."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. There is a clear way to differentiate between a package and a standalone application."
