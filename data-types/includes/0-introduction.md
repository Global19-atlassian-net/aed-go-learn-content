# Introduction
In previous modules, we covered the basic types in Go that serve as the foundation for building data structures in a Go program. In this module, we will cover the aggregate types we mentioned early: arrays and slices. You'll learn its differences and when to use one type versus the other one. Additionally, we'll cover maps and structs, which are also the foundation for manipulating data using Go and used for many web services.

Lastly, when we talk about structs, you'll learn how to build custom and complex data types, which will be useful when parsing JSON payloads.

## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will:

- Learn about the aggregate types in Go: arrays and slices
- Learn about the difference between arrays and slices
- Learn about built-in functions in Go to manipulate data
- Learn how to use key/value data structures using maps
- Learn how to write complex custom data types with structs

## Prerequisites
- A Go environment ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) installed. Alternatively, you could use the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).
- Able to create and modify `.go` files
- Able to run Go applications using the terminal prompt
- Knowledge of basic data types like `string`, `int`, and `boolean`
- Knowledge of how to write basic data control flows like `if` and `for` statements
