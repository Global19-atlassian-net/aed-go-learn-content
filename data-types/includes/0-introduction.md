# Introduction

In previous modules, we covered the basic data types in Go that serve as the foundation for building data structures in a Go program. In this module, we will cover the aggregate types we mentioned earlier: arrays and slices. You'll learn the differences between the two and when to use one type versus the other one. Additionally, we'll cover maps and structs, which are also the foundation for manipulating data using Go and used for many web services.

Lastly, you'll learn how to build custom and complex data types, which will be useful when parsing JSON payloads.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn about:

- The aggregate types in Go: arrays and slices
- The differences between arrays and slices
- Built-in functions to manipulate data
- How to use key/value data structures using maps
- How to write complex custom data types with structs

## Prerequisites

- A Go environment ready to create applications. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) installed. Alternatively, you could use the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).
- Be able to create and modify `.go` files
- Be able to run Go applications using the terminal prompt
- Have knowledge of basic data types like `string`, `int`, and `boolean`
- Have knowledge of how to write basic data control flows like `if` and `for` statements
