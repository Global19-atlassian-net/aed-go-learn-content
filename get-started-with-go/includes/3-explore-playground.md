# Exercise - Set up your development environment
We mentioned early in this module that if you don’t want to install Go on your local workstation yet, you can use the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/), a website that compiles and runs Go code inside a sandbox environment. Typically, this is the tool you use for sharing code snippets with other developers when sharing a solution in forums.

However, the Go Playground comes with a few limitations that might impact your learning journey, like:

* Keyboard inputs are not supported
* Random numbers are deterministic
* Time is constant. You get the same value every time.

Head over to the Go Playground, and click on the “Run” button.

Feel free to continue using this site for learning purposes, but we highly recommend installing Go locally and using an IDE to improve your development productivity.
