# Summary
What a ride! We've come to the end of learning the fundamentals in Go, and you've been writing several programs to practice. Now you're equipped to continue your learning journey in Go and start writing more complex programs. We didn't cover several topics in-depth, but we suggest you go deeper to understand how to write better code, that not only it's easy to change, but that runs fast. For instance, concurrency is a complex topic that there are even books dedicated to only that topic, and we just scratched the surface.

As you've seen, Go is very idiomatic in certain things like concurrency, error handling, the use of frameworks, etc. So there were times when you had to forget what you knew from other programming languages to understand why Go decides to implement things in a certain way. For instance, Go is not an OOP language, but many of OOP features can be implemented in Go.

A final recommendation from us is that you continue practicing, changing the exercises you've done through this module, extending the programs, etc. And above all, don't make any assumptions, write a test case, and probe any hypothesis you might have about Go.

Happy Coding!
